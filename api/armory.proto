Inter-exchange message

Each message includes a timestamp reference to allow the receiver to mitigate
replay attacks.

During a session each party must ensure that the timestamp of the received
message is older than the previous one, as well as not too far off in the
future.

To this end the UA sets its internal clock using the timestamp of the first
received valid message, from power-up, from the MD.

All payloads are encrypted, with the exception of PAIR and SESSION ones, using
AES-256 and the negotiated symmetric session encryption key. A random IV is
prepended to the encrypted payload.

1. Pairing sequence

   The pairing procedure is a pre-requisite for session establishment.

   Request, OpCode: PAIR, signed with MD long-term EC private key:
     MD > UA: KeyExchange{Key:<MD long-term EC public key>, Nonce:<pairing nonce>}

   Response, OpCode: PAIR, signed with UA long-term EC private key:
     MD < UA: standard response

   This sequence can only be used in pairing mode, the device must be restarted
   to exit pairing mode.

2. Session negotiation sequence

   New sessions can be negotiated at any time by the MD, invalidating the
   previous one. Sessions are volatile and therefore not persistent across UA
   reboots.

   Request, OpCode: SESSION, signed with MD long-term EC private key:
    MD > UA: KeyExchange{Key:<MD EC ephemeral public key>}

   Response, OpCode: SESSION, signed with UA long-term EC private key:
    MD < UA: KeyExchange{Key:<UA EC ephemeral public key>, Nonce:<HKDF nonce>}

3. Encrypted storage unlock

   This MD request instructs the UA to unlock its encrypted storage and
   expose it as USB Mass Storage.

   Request, OpCode: UNLOCK, signed with MD ephemeral EC private key, encrypted with session key
     MD > UA: KeyExchange{Key:<MD KEK>}

   Response, OpCode: UNLOCK, signed with UA ephemeral EC private key, encrypted with session key
     MD < UA: standard response

4. Encrypted storage lock

   Request, OpCode: LOCK, signed with MD ephemeral EC private key, encrypted with session key
     MD > UA: empty payload

   Response, OpCode: LOCK, signed with UA ephemeral EC private key, encrypted with session key

Any configuration change should be issued only while encrypted storage is
locked, otherwise an error is returned.
